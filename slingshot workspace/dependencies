```
# Core Python libraries (no need to install via pip as they come with Python)
# os, sys, threading, time, hashlib, secrets, subprocess, getpass, zipfile, socket, json, platform

# GUI Libraries
tkinter  # Part of Python standard library, but listed for clarity
customtkinter>=5.2.2  # For custom Tkinter widgets

# Concurrency
# concurrent.futures is part of Python standard library

# System Monitoring
psutil>=5.9.8  # For process and system utilities

# Plotting
matplotlib>=3.8.3  # For plotting system analytics

# Encryption
cryptography>=42.0.5  # For Fernet encryption

# HTTP Requests (implied for features like cloud backup or speed test)
requests>=2.31.0  # For making HTTP requests

# Optional: For advanced features that might need additional libraries
# These are placeholders based on unimplemented features; uncomment if used
# speedtest-cli>=2.1.3  # For speed_test feature
# scapy>=2.5.0  # For network-related features like traceroute or wifi_analyzer
# wmi>=1.5.1  # For Windows-specific features if expanded (list_startup_items)
```

### Notes:
1. **Standard Library Modules**: Modules like `os`, `sys`, `threading`, `time`, `tkinter`, `queue`, `hashlib`, `secrets`, `subprocess`, `getpass`, `zipfile`, `socket`, `logging`, `shutil`, and `json` are part of Python's standard library and donâ€™t need to be installed via pip.

2. **Customtkinter**: This is a third-party library extending Tkinter. The version `5.2.2` is the latest as of late 2023; check for updates since my knowledge is fresh up to March 2025.

3. **Psutil**: Used for system monitoring (CPU, memory, disk, processes). Version `5.9.8` is stable as of early 2024; ensure compatibility with your system.

4. **Matplotlib**: Required for the analytics tab plotting. Version `3.8.3` is recent; adjust if newer versions are preferred.

5. **Cryptography**: Used for Fernet encryption in password management and file encryption. Version `42.0.5` is current as of early 2024.

6. **Requests**: Implied for features like `cloud_backup` or `speed_test`, though not fully implemented in your code. Added as a common dependency for network operations.

7. **Optional Libraries**: Features like `speed_test`, `traceroute`, `wifi_analyzer`, or deeper Windows integration (e.g., `list_startup_items`) might require additional libraries like `speedtest-cli`, `scapy`, or `wmi`. These are commented out since your code uses placeholders or subprocess calls instead.

### How to Use:
1. Copy the text above into a file named `requirements.txt`.
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your terminal within the project directory to install these dependencies.
3. Adjust versions if you need specific ones or if newer versions are available by March 2025.
